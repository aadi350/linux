# Aadi's Dotfiles
This is a collection of all my configuration files used on Manjaro, if you want to give this a try, you can use the [install script](install.sh). 
Full disclaimer, there is no guarantee that this code is bug-free, this is what works for me on a daily, and is designed to be minimal and functional (but not necessarily full attractive)
